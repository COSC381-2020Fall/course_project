How to raise smart babies (+ kids!)", "description": "How do we play with our babies? How do we educate our babies? Let's talk about baby toys, child development, optimal learning environments & how to grow our baby's brain right from birth.\n\nHi friends! When it comes to child development and education our babies I honestly do not spend much time thinking about how I will help to grow my baby's brain. I love my children and I know their educations matter, but between the responsibility of day to day tasks, and the overall goal of keeping my kids alive and loves .. very little of my mental space goes to asking questions like .. what is the optimal learning environment for my baby?.. how can I teach my baby to crawl, grasp, walk, & think curiously? .. how can I help children be explorers who use their imaginations & have longer attention spans? .. In this video I talk about baby play and how we as parents and educators can be more intentional about our style of play and the toys we use to engage our babies and young children. Montessori has some brilliant ideas, originating from Marta Montessori of Italy, so I have tried to incorporate some of their beliefs into this video to support you in educating your child. I don't personally believe in spending a lot of money of baby toys.. I also don't think you need to read to your child every night.. or at the hospital when the baby is born.. or really anything that is going to cause further exhaustion or stress to a new parent's life ... that is not my style. I love the idea of incorporating little intentional moments of exploration into your child's life, in nearly effortless ways. From creating a simple beautiful environment for baby to spend time in, with less toys .. which means less clean up for you! To adding songs, stories, laughter, and just general talking to your normal everyday routines. There are easy things you can do to .. \"grow your baby's brain\" .. if that is your concern, and there are fun options for educating your little ones that don't have to be costly or tiring. \n\nYOU ARE A GREAT MOM. Have grace with yourself and do what you can to enjoy the motherhood role .. however tiring, confusing, emotional, fun and crazy it sometimes is.

The classroom environment consists of attractive manipulatives, educational toys that involve children in academic learning. \"The Montessori classroom is a \"prepared environment\" planned in advance to support independent, student-initiated work.\" In the classroom, children are free to select manipulative's of their preference and through curiosity and innate interest engage in learning activities of their own individual choice. In the traditional Montessori environment, children manipulate objects and discover the joy of learning while a teacher guides them and \"... by making discoveries with the materials, cultivating concentration, motivation, self-discipline, and a love of learning.\"\n\nThe traditional classroom setting consists of a teacher assigned to a group of students. Rather than guiding children through learning, the teacher's role is to instruct students. The job of the teacher is to provide each student with a firm foundation and enrich their minds by teaching the grade-level standards. In this setting, the teacher delivers the curriculum from textbooks, with an outline of the lesson to be taught that day. The students are seated in chairs or tables, either working by themselves or in collaborative groups, contingent on the set up of the classroom. In this setting, there exists a variety of learners however the teacher teaches from a whole group perspective. The outcome of student learning relies heavily on assessments or tests. Rather than constructively learning through manipulating their environment, the students in this setting are taught in a very structured environment.

The Montessori primary (age 3-6) classroom environment is very different from other preschools, and many parents find it hard to know what to look for when choosing a Montessori school. This video highlights key attributes of a well-run, authentic Montessori preschool: the classroom environment, the teaching approach and the children's behavior and capabilities. This video was taken in Fall 2010 at LePort Montessori in Orange County, CA. Learn more about our schools and the authentic Montessori approach we take at www.leport.com.\n\nLePort Montessori Schools: www.leport.com\nWhy LePort Montessori: www.leport.com/why-leport/\nOur Programs: www.leport.com/programs/\n\nSee our locations in California, New York, and Virginia: www.leport.com/locations"}, {"id": "UzmvtVAuuyI", "title": "Montessori School Education", "description": "To help us to make more such videos, visit http://www.patreon.com/sprouts\n\nMontessori Education is based on the principles developed by Maria Montessori, who opened her first school for children of low-income workers in an apartment building in Rome in 1907. The school was called \u201cCasa Dei Bambini\u201d, Home for Children.\n\nThis first \u201cCasa\u201d was furnished with a teacher's table, a stove, a blackboard, some chairs, group tables for the children and a cabinet filled with materials that Montessori developed in her earlier career when she researched how to teach kids who experience some form of mental disability. \nMaria Montessori created the materials after she realized that students seem to understand complex concepts better when they engaged all their senses.\n\nActivities at this first school included personal care (such as dressing and undressing), care of the environment like sweeping, dusting and gardening. Otherwise, they were free to move around and play with the materials. Montessori did not teach herself but instead oversaw the classroom work of her teachers.\n\nMontessori observed that children showed episodes of deep concentration and multiple repetitions of the same activity. Given free choice, kids showed more interest in practical activities and the materials than normal toys, sweets or other rewards. Over time spontaneous self-discipline emerged.\n\nMontessori concluded that working independently children seemed to reach new levels of autonomy and become self-motivated learners. She began to see the role of the teacher as a facilitator of young human beings who are free to move and act within the limits of a prepared environment. The goal: to grow children to become independent and responsible adults who share a love for learning.\n\nSoon after Montessori herself and her ideas started traveling the world to inspired progressive thinkers and educators from all over. The inventors, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, became early advocates. Later alumni include Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia, author Gabriel Garcia Marquez as well as the two Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nToday the term \u201cMontessori\u201d stands more for a method, than a school itself. The fact that it can be used freely by anyone led to a great variation of schools. Educators all over the world borrow Montessori's name, insights, and materials to organize kindergartens, elementary schools, special needs programs, or even full 12-year curriculums. Some parents use it for homeschooling.\n\n\nThe following characteristics are shared among most programs:\n\n- Students are free to choose what to learn\n- Open classrooms that allow free movement\n- Use of specialized Montessori materials \n- Mixed-age classes (from 0-3, 3-6 or 6-12) so children can learn from each other\n- Uninterrupted blocks of study time, usually three hours\n- No grading or homework\n- and a trained teacher\n\nMaria Montessori once famously said: \u201cNever help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed.\u201dWhat are your thoughts on Montessori?

This video introduces the first set of 7 sets of letters that will be taught using the Montessori 3 period lesson in the following order (recommended by Tim Seldin author of How to Raise an Amazing Child the Montessori Way). \n\nSet 1 c, m, a, t - https://youtu.be/mXQkjSQiqAs\nSet 2 s, r, i, p - https://youtu.be/Qu_nj28BsuA\nSet 3 b, f, o, g - https://youtu.be/6HSI4F6YU_0\nSet 4 h, j, u, l - https://youtu.be/8fvgy2ialhg\nSet 5 d, w, e, n - https://youtu.be/V4HHjmxj4hE\nSet 6 k, q, v - https://youtu.be/1j8WosCD8ec\nSet 7 x, y, z -  https://youtu.be/sJrP28o5HGI\n\n..................................................\n\nIntroduction of the letters using the time tested Montessori 3 period lesson is implemented as follows:\n\n1. Identify the sounds of an isolated letter \u2013 \u201cthis is\u201d \nIn the first stage we will make the sounds of letters when we trace and write them, and we will also reinforce learning with objects that begin with the sounds of each letter.\n\nWhen we have identified the sounds of the letters we will see if we can associate/recognize the sounds of letters in stage 2.\n\n2. Associate/Recognize \u2013 \u201cshow me\u201d \nIn stage 2 we see the group of letters that we previously identified the sounds of and show where a letter that makes a specific sound is upon request.\n\n3. Recall \u2013 \u201cwhat is this\u201d\nIn stage 3 we say the sound of the letter indicated upon request.\n\nMontessori Sandpaper Letters are used to introduce the names and phonetic sound for each letter in preparation for reading. Tracing a letter with the fingertips whilst making the phonetic sound provides a tactile sensation to form both a visual and sensory impression to reinforce learning. This also develops a muscular memory that will help your child\u2019s hand and mind become familiar with movements required to form each letter and be useful when s/he starts to write.\n\nMontessori Sandpaper Letters can be purchased online or go to the description in my video at https://youtu.be/l4Y-J_mWfw0 for information on how to make DIY Montessori Sandpaper Letters. \n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nHelp me grow Cheriebooks Kids Learning Channel by liking, sharing, commenting and SUBSCRIBING at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCacnSUkviry5AkhtdlAkDNQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo stay tuned and join in with weekly educational video updates for children, don\u2019t forget to click on the notifications bell icon!\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nFind out more about Cheriebooks Educational Multimedia Interactive eBooks for Children at http://www.cheriebooks.com\n\n.............................................\n\nSupport literacy for children by becoming my patron and make a contribution starting at $2, towards the creation of educational multi-media eBooks and Cheriebooks Kids Learning Channel created to build literacy skills for children at https://www.patreon.com/cheriebooks\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n\nFOLLOW  at : \n  \nIG: https://www.instagram.com/cheriebooks/\nFB:  https://www.facebook.com/cheriebooks1/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/cheriebooks\nTpT: https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Cheriebooks\n\n..............................................\n........................\n\u092e\u094b\u0902\u091f\u0947\u0938\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u091c\u0940 \u0928\u093e\u0926\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0924\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\n........................\n\u09ae\u09a8\u09cd\u099f\u09c7\u09b8\u09b0\u09bf \u0987\u0982\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6 \u09ab\u09cb\u09a8\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8 \u0995\u09cd\u09b0\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u0995\u09b2\u09be\u09aa\n........................\n\u0a2e\u0a4b\u0a02\u0a1f\u0a47\u0a38\u0a30\u0a40 \u0a07\u0a70\u0a17\u0a32\u0a3f\u0a38\u0a3c \u0a2b\u0a4b\u0a28\u0a3f\u0a15\u0a38 \u0a17\u0a24\u0a40\u0a35\u0a3f\u0a27\u0a40\n........................\n\u8499\u7279\u68ad\u5229\u82f1\u8a9e\u62fc\u97f3\u6d3b\u52d5\n........................\n\u30e2\u30f3\u30c6\u30c3\u30bd\u30fc\u30ea\u82f1\u8a9e\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u6d3b\u52d5\n........................\nAktibidad sa Phonics ng Montessori Ingles\n........................\negiatan Fonetik Bahasa Inggris Montessori\n........................\nAtividade de fon\u00e9tica em ingl\u00eas de Montessori\n........................\nMontessori \u0130ngilizce Fonetik Etkinli\u011fi\n..........................\nActivit\u00e9 de phon\u00e9tique anglaise Montessori\n............................\nActividad Montessori English Phonics\n.............................\n\u092e\u094b\u0928\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0938\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u091c\u0940 \u092b\u094b\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0917\u0924\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\n..............................\n\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\n..............................\n\nMusic: www.bensound.com"}, {"id": "M-gVvZ0uZRU", "title": "What is Montessori Education? \u2606 Easily Explained, in English", "description": "\u2714  Free Crypto-Coins: https://crypto-airdrops.de\n\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\n\n In this video you will learn about Montessori Education.

As kids grow up and get too big for a crib, floor\u00a0beds\u00a0enable freedom of movement, independence, and mobility. They can move around, explore their environments, and wake up and move around without being trapped in the crib. They're awesome! Now that our kiddo is a toddler, it was time to make him a wicked awesome floor bed.\n\nThe DIY Montessori Bed we made is super extra and is Dragon and Viking themed, built to look like a Viking Longship. Specifically, we used the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" films as our inspiration. Jaimie worked on the film trilogy when she was at Dreamworks so we had artwork around the house that inspired us to make this awesome Dragon Montessori Bed.\n\nThis DIY project was incredibly fun to make and our son LOVES IT. If you're considering building a floor bed for your kiddos, we highly recommend it. Check out our DIY Floor Bed plans on our website if you want to follow along with this build and make your own Montessori Bed!\n\nMATERIALS:\n1x6\" Pine\n1x8\" Pine\n2x4\" Pine\n3/4\" Plywood\nWalnut-colored Stain\nMilk Paint\n1\" Wood Screws\n2.5\" Machine Screws w/ 1/4\" Barrel Nuts\n\n(These are affiliate links and they help support our channel!)\n\nTOOLS USED:\nMiter Saw - https://amzn.to/3bpoEUu\nCircular Saw - https://amzn.to/3bj2Z0m\nDrill - https://amzn.to/2SvF6tQ\nImpact Driver - https://amzn.to/2SvF6tQ\nKreg Jig - https://amzn.to/2WbyFQ6\nAngle Grinder - https://amzn.to/3aMYZ76\nKutzall Shaping Disc - https://amzn.to/2Qb8t4a\nChisel - https://amzn.to/2En3WoS\nMallet - https://amzn.to/2HclFSH\nTape Measure - https://amzn.to/2C00Jv7\nPencil\nCNC (Optional, not needed)\n\n#DIY\n#MontessoriBed\n#FloorBed"}, {"id": "fd9LuiKndMs", "title": "Teacher Discussion: Presenting Montessori Geometric Solids", "description": "Study of 3D Geometric Forms Teacher Discussion\r\nKym Elder\r\nMontessori Live Educator Training Program \r\n#105801"}, {"id": "mEJTBWPTpQU", "title": "Introduction to Montessori Handwriting Sequence", "description": "Teacher Discussion Montessori Handwriting Sequence\r\nMontessori Live Educator Training Program\r\n#101404"}, {"id": "Z9fHShu8YJ4", "title": "MONTESSORI AT HOME: Your Floor Bed Questions ANSWERED!", "description": "MONTESSORI AT HOME: Your Floor Bed Questions ANSWERED!  // Learn the answers to the most commonly asked questions about using a floor bed for your Montessori child, including tips for safety, how to respond when your child gets out of bed or tries to leave the room, and helping your baby learn to fall asleep independently!\n\n********\n\nWant to learn more about how to do Montessori at home?

This is Set 5 introducing how to teach the letters D, W, E and N to children, preschoolers and toddlers using phonetic sounds rather than letter names. I teach the letters in an order that allows children / early readers to make many words with the letters they have learned early on in the sequence. \n\nThere are variations in the sequence / order in which letters can be introduced to children / early readers. This video introduces the fifth set of 7 sets of letters that will be taught using the Montessori 3 period lesson in the following order (recommended by Tim Seldin author of How to Raise an Amazing Child the Montessori Way). \n\nSet 1 c, m, a, t - https://youtu.be/mXQkjSQiqAs\nSet 2 s, r, i, p - https://youtu.be/Qu_nj28BsuA\nSet 3 b, f, o, g - https://youtu.be/6HSI4F6YU_0\nSet 4 h, j, u, l - https://youtu.be/8fvgy2ialhg\nSet 5 d, w, e, n - https://youtu.be/V4HHjmxj4hE\nSet 6 k, q, v - https://youtu.be/1j8WosCD8ec\nSet 7 x, y, z -  https://youtu.be/sJrP28o5HGI\n\n..................................................\n\nIntroduction of the letters using the time tested Montessori 3 period lesson is implemented as follows:\n\n1. Identify the sounds of an isolated letter \u2013 \u201cthis is\u201d \nIn the first stage we will make the sounds of letters when we trace and write them, and we will also reinforce learning with objects that begin with the sounds of each letter.\n\nWhen we have identified the sounds of the letters we will see if we can associate/recognize the sounds of letters in stage 2.\n\n2. Associate/Recognize \u2013 \u201cshow me\u201d \nIn stage 2 we see the group of letters that we previously identified the sounds of and show where a letter that makes a specific sound is upon request.\n\n3.

With this simple method, baby will learn how to drink from a cup and eventually wean off the breast or bottle, skipping the skippy cup and straws entirely. \n\nThe method: \n\nIntroduce your baby a child-sized cup (\u201cweaning cup\u201d) as early as 6 months. Offer them many chances to handle it; also regularly model its use. After meals, offer baby sips of water from the cup. You can hold the cup at first, but let baby gradually take control. Accept that spills will and should happen. Have a towel ready to dry any messes up.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that cup learning happens in stages:\n\nFirst, baby must learn to pick up and grasp the cup with both hands.\n\nSecond, baby must learn to lift the cup to his mouth.\n\nThird, the baby must learn to control his speed and aim.\n\nFourth, the baby must learn to take a sip.\n\nFifth, the baby must learn to lower the cup after drinking, and place it back on the table!\n\nAs you can see, cup training requires a lot of practice!\n\nLuckily, cup training can be fun \u2014 especially if you start early.\n\nMany of you might be wondering about older babies and toddlers who resist drinking from open cups, and prefer bottles or sippy cups.\n\nIs there a fun and respectful way to get them to drink from open cups, too?\n\nYes! You can use fun cups, slow-flowing liquids, and a systematic approach to help overcome their resistance, as you\u2019ll see in the short video above.\n\nRecommended readings: \n\nUnderstanding the Human Being, by Dr. Silvana Montanaro\n\nThe Joyful Child, by Susan Mayclin Stephenson\n\nThis is an update to our previous video, which you can see here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loe975JLQNQ"}, {"id": "2Mt_HOHOKW4", "title": "MONTESSORI AT HOME: Eating Approach", "description": "MONTESSORI AT HOME: EATING APPROACH // Learn about the Montessori approach to eating and mealtime for babies and toddlers.\n\n********\n\nWant to learn more about how to do Montessori at home?
